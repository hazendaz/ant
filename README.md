This project takes apache ant distribution from mirror downloads for distribution using maven central.

For more information on ant, please see [ant](https://github.com/apache/ant)

# Motivation #

Apache Ant does not currently provide a maven central distribution of the entire project. This project aims to solve that by providing users an alternative location to pull rather than the various apache mirror sites.

# Use Case #

Maven based storage of distribution in common location to offer more secure download location.
